## Overview
This files are for making Single RGB image-based foreground/background 2.5D data composition and image post-processing testbed 
<img scr = "image1.png">

## Datasets
FFHQ (512 X 512) dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/arnaud58/flickrfaceshq-dataset-ffhq)
COCO dataset can be downloaded from [COCOdataset] (https://cocodataset.org/#download)
Use Our Mask files from mask folder or make your own mask files
Prepare your own dataset to use your dataset 

## Requirements and install
1. Create virtual environment
Create virtual environment with python version 3.7. Then Activate your virtual environment
```bash
conda create â€“n test python=3.7
conda activate test
```

2. Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 or
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pillow
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tqdm
pip install matplotlib
pip install visdom
pip install timm
pip install opencv   or   conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

3. Download Pre-train model

 Download Deeplab V3+ Pre-train model from [Deeplab V3+](https://github.com/VainF/DeepLabV3Plus-Pytorch) and put it in DeepLabV3/checkpoints folder

 Download MiDaS Pre-train model from [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) and put it in MiDaS/weights folder

 Download Co-Modulated-GAN Pre-trian model using the command below and put it in checkpoints folder
```bash
download places512.sh   or    download ffhq512.sh
```

## RUN

1. Run the command below to test our file

```bash
python test.py -i [input folder]
```


2. Run the command below to test about FFHQ 

(This does not make  segment, fore/backgournd, mask and depth images) 

```bash
python test_ffhq.py -i [input folder(ffhq images)] -m [mask folder]
```

3. To test one image from uploading in local, use test_one_image.ipynb
first install jupyter_innotater
```bash
pip install jupyter_innotater
```
Then run cells in test_one_image.ipynb at jupyter lab

## Evalutate

If you want to evaluate ssim score from input and output, use the command below 

```bash
python ssim_eval.py -f [first(input) image folder] -s [second(output) image folder]
```
